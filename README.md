# dplyr_learnr

An example of a simple learnR markdown tutorial - bringing in data in an interactive format that can be explored through a data table and then some coding challenges. For those with no real background in coding - working through these code chunks served as a nice bridge to writing code without having to navigate through a script - and once more code was learnt, with some relatively interesting examples, then there was more motivation to follow through on the admin side of laying out code into nicely formatted markdown scripts.

I've skipped to one of the more interesting questions which challenges participants to start questioning what they are doing in real terms, beyond just the mechanics of writing the code.

The tutorial can be viewed online here:

Intentionally the formatting is kept to a minimum within the RMD file. That way by the time we get to the end of the course the participants are then able to see exactly how relatively simple it is to construct a coherent script without putting in a lot of flashy, but more complicated, formatting.
